# Description
---
Run Holmes helps users reach their running goals. The application uses a unique algorithm, backed by research from thought-leaders in the running community, to develop a mileage-based training plan. Users can download their plan as an excel doc from the homepage or create an account to take advantage of several accountability features. Once logged-in, users can mark off completed runs and track their progress on the runner dashboard. They can also sign-up for reminders via SMS or email, and add running workouts directly to their Google Calendars. With Run Holmes, users have all of the tools and motivation needed to meet and exceed their running goals.
